This project is an encryption project . 
you give 8 bits of data and 8 bits of key to a LFSF module which works with clock and gives you an encrypted 8-bit data after 10 clock pulses ( you can change the clock pulse limit but it must be more than 8 clocks at least .)
The project is divided into two parts ( labeled in the main page as Encryption & Decryption ).
Have Fun !
